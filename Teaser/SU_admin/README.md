The worst thing with this one is that we couldn't find the flag despite all our efforts, till we saw a write up of the Hacky holidays 2021 with the same Teaser. [here](https://youtu.be/hY446_xs-DE?t=56)

The only thing we had to do was to find the **hidden boutons** for the shapes and the color in the html. We felt really dumb ;-;

After making them **visible** just by changing their names you would have a lot more choice :
